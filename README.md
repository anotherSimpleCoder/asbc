# ASBC
*Another Simple Bitwarden Client*

## About

As the name says, ASBC is just a simple Bitwarden Client written in Javascript based on Node.js and
Electron. It's actually nothing more than a chromium platform displaying the Bitwarden Web Vault.
I just made this for myself, but if you wanna use it free to do so.


## Installation (i guess)

In the bin directory of this repository there are 3 folders.

```deb```<br/>
This directory contains a package installer for Debian and it's based distros (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.)

```rpm```<br/>	
This directoy contains a package installer for Redhat Linux and it's based distros (such as Fedora, CentOS, etc.)

```linux```<br/>
This directory contains the binary executable for linux with a folder containing libraries and stuff.
I also included a setup script, which generates a desktop file for you to access asbc easier through
your desktop environment (I hope this works also outside of KDE) and moves file into their respective paths.
